## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the card hover transition effect up and running on your website.

### Prerequisites

You only need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS to implement this effect successfully.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/css-card-hover-transition.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred code editor.

3. Locate the CSS section in the `<head>` of the HTML file.

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

4. Customize the styles in the `styles.css` file to match your website's design. You can modify colors, fonts, dimensions, and more to fit your branding.

5. In the `index.html` file, find the card element you want to apply the hover transition effect to. It will look like this:

```html
<div class="card">
    <img src="card-image.jpg" alt="Card Image">
    <div class="card-content">
        <h2>Card Title</h2>
        <p>Card description goes here.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

6. Add the `hover-card` class to the `card` element:

```html
<div class="card hover-card">
    <!-- ... rest of the card content ... -->
</div>
```

7. Save your changes and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Hover over the card to see the transition effect in action.

### Customization

You can customize the transition effect by modifying the CSS code in the `styles.css` file. The key CSS class responsible for the transition effect is `.hover-card`.

Feel free to experiment with different properties such as `transform`, `box-shadow`, and `transition` to achieve the desired animation and appearance.
